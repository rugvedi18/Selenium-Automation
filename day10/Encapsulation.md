# Encapsulation

Advantage :- Privacy of data

1. Wrapping up of data and methods into single unit (class).
2. We can access variables only through methods (setters & getters)
3. All variables should be private.

## Static keyword

Advantage :- Avoids duplication

1. Prevents unnecessary memory allocation
2. Static methods can access static stuff directly without creating object
3. Static methods can access non-static stuff using object
