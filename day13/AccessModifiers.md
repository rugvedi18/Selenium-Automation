# Access Modifiers

1. Public - Everywhere without inheritance
2. Protected - In other package but using inheritance
3. Default - Inside other classes within same package
4. Private - In class

Public - We will be able to access the variables/methods inside the class, outside the class and outside the package, in other package we can access without inheritance.

Protected - We will be able to access the variables/methods inside the class, outside the class and outside the package, in other package we can access but through inheritance.

Default - We will be able to access the variables/methods inside and outside the class but inside the same package. If we don't specify anyother access modifier to variables/methods, then they will be default, no need to write default keyword.

Private - We will be able to access the variables/methods only within the class.
